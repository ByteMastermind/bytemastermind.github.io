# Wi-Fi Protected Access

## Introduction


Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) is a security standard developed for wireless networks with the primary objective of replacing the less secure Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) standard, which was established in 1997. The Wi-Fi Alliance, a consortium of industry stakeholders, spearheaded the development of WPA to address the critical vulnerabilities inherent in WEP.

WPA's introduction sought to bolster the security of wireless communication by implementing robust encryption protocols and advanced authentication mechanisms. Compared to WEP, WPA offered superior protection against various attacks, enhancing the overall integrity and confidentiality of data transmitted over Wi-Fi networks.

For the successful adoption of WPA, it was essential to upgrade wireless network interface cards designed for WEP to support the new standard. Fortunately, this upgrade could be achieved through firmware updates, allowing existing hardware to take advantage of the enhanced security provided by WPA.

However, while the transition to WPA was relatively straightforward for many wireless network interface cards, a significant limitation arose concerning pre-2003 wireless access points. Due to substantial changes in the security architecture, most of these legacy access points were unable to be upgraded to support WPA through firmware updates. Consequently, users of such access points faced the challenge of either replacing their hardware or seeking alternative security measures to protect their wireless networks effectively.

In summary, WPA emerged as a crucial improvement over the vulnerable WEP standard, significantly enhancing the security posture of wireless networks. While upgrading wireless network interface cards to support WPA was generally achievable through firmware updates, the incompatibility issue with certain older access points presented a noteworthy obstacle during the migration process.
