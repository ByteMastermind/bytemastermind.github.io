Hello, I'm Michal Beneš, an AppSec engineer, penetration tester and computer security master's student at CTU Prague. My area of expertise is web security, and I specialise in identifying and resolving security vulnerabilities.

This blog is mainly intended for note-taking purposes and for sharing the things I have learnt.
